# haxe-musicpd

If you use lix, you can install the latest version with:

```sh
lix install gitlab:haxe-grig/haxe-musicpd
```

## Todo

- everything from listfiles on
- fix random Eof errors in thinamp
- submit to haxelib 1st version
- add documentation to functions and generate haxe documentation (dox)
- make any transpiled libs that would help people (if the language doesn't already have a good mpd client)
- add tests, at least in gitlab
- implement command lists
- implement objects to represent filters instead of making users of the api escape themselves
