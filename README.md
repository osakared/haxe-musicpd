# haxe-musicpd

## Todo

- everything from albumart on
- change things where entire range is needed to separate typedef than `PosOrRange`
- fix random Eof errors in thinamp
- submit to haxelib 1st version
- add documentation to functions and generate haxe documentation (dox)
- make any transpiled libs that would help people (if the language doesn't already have a good mpd client)
